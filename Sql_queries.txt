SQL Queries	

sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column) LIKE '%YY';



Certainly! To efficiently delete rows of a particular year in a large table in Oracle DB, you can use subsets or cursor-based approach. Here's an example of both methods:

Using Subsets:
```sql
DELETE FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column) = 2022;
```
In this example, `your_table` is the name of your table, and `date_column` is the column that contains the date you want to filter. Replace these with your actual table and column names. The `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column)` function extracts the year from the date and compares it with the desired year (2022 in this case). This approach directly deletes the matching rows without using cursors.

Using Cursors:
```sql
DECLARE
  CURSOR c1 IS
    SELECT *
    FROM your_table
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column) = 2022;
BEGIN
  FOR r1 IN c1 LOOP
    DELETE FROM your_table WHERE CURRENT OF c1;
  END LOOP;
  COMMIT;
END;
```
In this example, a cursor named `c1` is defined to select the rows that match the desired year. Then, a loop is used to iterate over each row fetched by the cursor, and the `DELETE` statement is executed for each row using the `CURRENT OF` clause. Finally, the `COMMIT` statement is used to save the changes.

Please note that before running any delete operation, it's essential to have a backup of your data or perform a thorough validation to ensure that you are deleting the correct rows.

To delete rows from all relational tables for a specific year using an SQL procedure, you can use dynamic SQL to generate and execute the necessary DELETE statements. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteRowsByYear (@targetYear INT)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @tableName NVARCHAR(128);
    DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX);

    -- Cursor to loop through all tables in the database
    DECLARE tableCursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT TABLE_NAME
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE';

    -- Temporary table to store the DELETE statements
    CREATE TABLE #DeleteStatements
    (
        Statement NVARCHAR(MAX)
    );

    OPEN tableCursor;
    FETCH NEXT FROM tableCursor INTO @tableName;

    -- Loop through each table and generate DELETE statements
    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        SET @sql = N'DELETE FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@tableName) + N' WHERE YEAR(order_date) = @targetYear;';
        INSERT INTO #DeleteStatements (Statement) VALUES (@sql);

        FETCH NEXT FROM tableCursor INTO @tableName;
    END;

    CLOSE tableCursor;
    DEALLOCATE tableCursor;

    -- Execute the generated DELETE statements
    DECLARE @deleteSql NVARCHAR(MAX);
    DECLARE deleteCursor CURSOR FOR SELECT Statement FROM #DeleteStatements;

    OPEN deleteCursor;
    FETCH NEXT FROM deleteCursor INTO @deleteSql;

    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        EXEC sp_executesql @deleteSql, N'@targetYear INT', @targetYear;

        FETCH NEXT FROM deleteCursor INTO @deleteSql;
    END;

    CLOSE deleteCursor;
    DEALLOCATE deleteCursor;

    -- Clean up temporary table
    DROP TABLE #DeleteStatements;
END;
```

In this example, the procedure loops through all the base tables in the database using a cursor. For each table, it generates a dynamic DELETE statement based on the table name and the year condition. The generated DELETE statements are stored in a temporary table. Finally, the procedure executes each DELETE statement using another cursor.

To use this procedure, you can call it by passing the desired year as an argument:

```sql
EXEC DeleteRowsByYear @targetYear = 2022;
```

This will generate and execute DELETE statements for all the base tables in the database, deleting rows where the specified year condition is met.

Please note that this example assumes that the tables have a column named `order_date` that represents the date or year information. You may need to modify the code to match your specific table structure and column names. Also, be cautious when executing such a procedure as it will delete data from all tables, so make sure to have proper backups and test it thoroughly before running it in a production environment.

To delete rows for certain years in multiple tables efficiently using an SQL procedure, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an SQL procedure that performs the deletion operations for each table. The procedure should accept the year as a parameter.

2. Identify the tables that contain the data you want to delete rows from.

3. Determine the condition for selecting rows based on the specific year you want to delete. For example, if you want to delete rows for the year 2022, the condition could be something like `YEAR(date_column) = 2022`.

4. Write an SQL DELETE statement for each table within the procedure, specifying the condition to delete rows for the desired year. Here's an example:

   ```sql
   CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteRowsForYear(year_param INT)
   BEGIN
     DELETE FROM table1
     WHERE YEAR(date_column) = year_param;
     
     DELETE FROM table2
     WHERE YEAR(date_column) = year_param;
     
     -- Repeat the DELETE statement for each table you identified
   END;
   ```

   Repeat the DELETE statement for each table you identified in step 2, ensuring that you adjust the table name and the condition accordingly.

5. Execute the SQL procedure by passing the desired year as a parameter. This will trigger the deletion of rows for that year in multiple tables.

By using an SQL procedure, you can execute the delete statements for multiple tables sequentially within a single procedure call. However, keep in mind that this approach performs the deletions sequentially rather than in parallel. If you want to execute the delete operations in parallel, you may need to employ other techniques specific to your database system, such as using multiple database connections or threads to execute the procedure concurrently.





sql
DELETE FROM your_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM your_date_column) = 2023;

sql
DELETE FROM your_table
WHERE YEAR(your_date_column) = 2023;

sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM your_table
WHERE YEAR(your_date_column) = 2023;



sql
SELECT table_name, num_rows
FROM dba_tables
WHERE owner = 'your_schema'
ORDER BY num_rows DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
