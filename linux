To search for the "I 23/3/2024" pattern only in the `server.logs` file generated on 23/3/2024, remove duplicates, and store the output in a new file, you can use the following command:

```bash
grep -h "I 23/3/2024" $(find /path/to/logs/directory -name "server.logs" -newermt "2024-03-23" ! -newermt "2024-03-24") | sed 's/^I 23\/3\/2024//' | sort -u > output_file.txt | sort -u -o output_file.txt output_file.txt

```

In this updated command:
- `grep -h "I 23/3/2024" $(find /path/to/logs/directory -name "server.logs" -newermt "2024-03-23" ! -newermt "2024-03-24")` searches for lines starting with "I 23/3/2024" in the identified `server.logs` file.
- `sed 's/^I 23\/3\/2024//'` removes the date from the matched lines.
- `sort -u` sorts the lines and removes duplicates.
- `> output_file.txt` stores the unique lines in the `output_file.txt` file.

Yes, you can remove duplicate lines from the output file and overwrite the same file using the following command:

```bash
sort -u -o output_file.txt output_file.txt
```

This command will sort the lines in `output_file.txt`, remove duplicates, and then overwrite the original file with the unique lines.

You can compress files generated between a particular time in Linux using the `find` command in combination with `tar`. Here's an example command that finds files generated between two specific dates and compresses them into a tar archive:

```bash
find /path/to/directory -type f -newermt 2024-01-01 ! -newermt 2024-02-01 -exec tar -rvf archive.tar {} +
```

In this command:
- Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual directory path you want to search.
- The dates `2024-01-01` and `2024-02-01` should be adjusted to your specific time range.
- The `tar` command creates or appends files to the `archive.tar` file.
  
After running this command, you'll have a tar archive containing the files generated within the specified time range.

You can delete huge size files that were generated within a specific time range in Linux using the `find` command along with the `rm` command. Here's an example command to delete files larger than a certain size that were generated between two specific dates:

```bash
find /path/to/directory -type f -size +100M -newermt 2024-01-01 ! -newermt 2024-02-01 -delete
```

In this command:
- Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual directory path you want to search.
- Adjust the file size (`+100M` in this example) to your desired threshold.
- The dates `2024-01-01` and `2024-02-01` should be modified according to your specific time range.
- The `delete` option at the end of the command will delete the files that meet the criteria.

Please be cautious while using the `delete` option with the `find` command as it permanently removes files without moving them to the trash. Make sure you have backups or are certain about the files you are deleting.
