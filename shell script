To loop over a list of lines in a text file using a shell script, you can use a `while` loop in combination with the `read` command. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Assuming your text file is named "list.txt"
file="list.txt"

# Check if the file exists
if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        # Process each line here
        echo "Processing line: $line"
    done < "$file"
else
    echo "File not found: $file"
fi
```

In this script:
- `while` loop reads each line from the file specified by `file`.
- `read -r line` reads each line from the file and stores it in the variable `line`.
- `IFS=` prevents leading/trailing whitespace from being trimmed.
- `echo "Processing line: $line"` is where you can perform operations on each line. Replace this with your actual processing logic.

Remember to replace `"list.txt"` with the actual path to your text file. This script will read each line from the file and process it as needed.

To check if an HTTP response shows that a session is not valid and renew the session using a shell script, you can use tools like cURL and jq (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor). Here's a general outline of how you can achieve this:

1. Make an HTTP request to check the session validity using cURL and save the response to a file:

```bash
curl -s -o response.json -X GET http://your-api-endpoint
```

2. Check if the session is invalid in the response JSON using jq:

```bash
invalid_session=$(jq -r '.error' response.json)
```

3. If the session is invalid, renew the session by making a new HTTP request to obtain a new session token:

```bash
if [[ "$invalid_session" == "Session not valid" ]]; then
    # Add logic to renew the session, e.g., by making another request to obtain a new session token
    curl -s -o new_token.json -X POST http://your-auth-endpoint
fi
```

4. You can then proceed with your original request using the new session token.

Remember to replace `http://your-api-endpoint` with your actual API endpoint and `http://your-auth-endpoint` with your actual authentication endpoint. This is a basic outline, and you may need to adapt it to suit your specific requirements and API endpoints.
