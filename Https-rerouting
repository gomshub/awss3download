To configure HTTPS routing in Apache Load Balancer for a Tomcat web service URL, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Install and configure Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy and mod_proxy_balancer modules. These modules enable reverse proxy and load balancing functionality.

2. Configure SSL/TLS certificate on Apache HTTP Server to enable HTTPS. You can obtain and install an SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA) or use a self-signed certificate for testing purposes.

3. Configure the virtual host in Apache HTTP Server to handle HTTPS requests and proxy them to the Tomcat backend servers. Here's an example configuration:

   ```
   <VirtualHost *:443>
     ServerName example.com
     SSLEngine on
     SSLCertificateFile /path/to/ssl_certificate.crt
     SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/ssl_private_key.key

     ProxyPass / http://tomcat-server1:8080/ route=worker1
     ProxyPassReverse / http://tomcat-server1:8080/

     ProxyPass / http://tomcat-server2:8080/ route=worker2
     ProxyPassReverse / http://tomcat-server2:8080/

     <Proxy balancer://mycluster>
       BalancerMember http://tomcat-server1:8080 route=worker1
       BalancerMember http://tomcat-server2:8080 route=worker2
       ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
     </Proxy>

     ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/
     ProxyPassReverse / balancer://mycluster/
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

   In this example, replace `example.com` with your domain name, `/path/to/ssl_certificate.crt` and `/path/to/ssl_private_key.key` with the paths to your SSL certificate and private key files, and `tomcat-server1:8080` and `tomcat-server2:8080` with the actual addresses of your Tomcat backend servers.

   The `ProxyPass` directives specify the routing for the web service URLs to the corresponding Tomcat servers. The `<Proxy>` and `BalancerMember` directives define the load balancing configuration.

4. Restart the Apache HTTP Server to apply the configuration changes.

With this configuration, Apache HTTP Server acts as a reverse proxy that handles HTTPS requests and forwards them to the Tomcat backend servers using the configured load balancing algorithm.

Note: Ensure that the necessary firewall rules and network configurations are in place to allow traffic between the Apache HTTP Server and the Tomcat backend servers.

Remember to adjust the configuration according to your specific environment and requirements.
