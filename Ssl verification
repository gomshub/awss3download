To generate a CRT chain and key for a host URL, you can use the `openssl` command-line tool. Here's an example of how you can generate a self-signed certificate chain (CRT) and private key for a host URL:

```shell
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private_key.key -out certificate.crt -subj "/CN=your-host-url"
```

This command generates a self-signed certificate and private key using the RSA algorithm with a key size of 2048 bits. The certificate is valid for 365 days (`-days 365`). The private key is saved to the `private_key.key` file, and the certificate chain is saved to the `certificate.crt` file.

Make sure to replace `"your-host-url"` with the actual URL or hostname you want to generate the certificate for. The `-subj` option specifies the subject of the certificate, including the common name (CN) field.

Note that a self-signed certificate should only be used for testing or development purposes. For production use, it's recommended to obtain a certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA).


=====##

python
import ssl

# Path to the PEM file
pem_file = '/path/to/certificate.pem'

# Load the PEM file
context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=pem_file)

# Connect to the server using the context
# For example, if you're using the requests library:
import requests
response = requests.get('https://example.com', verify=pem_file)

# Check the validation result
if response.ok:
    print("Certificate chain is valid.")
else:
    print("Certificate chain is not valid.")


====###

python
import urllib.request
import ssl

# Create a context with certificate validation
context = ssl.create_default_context()

# Set the verification parameters for the context
context.check_hostname = True
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED

# Make sure to provide the path to the certificate PEM file
pem_file = '/path/to/certificate.pem'

# Create an HTTPSHandler with the custom context
https_handler = urllib.request.HTTPSHandler(context=context)

# Create an opener with the HTTPSHandler
opener = urllib.request.build_opener(https_handler)

# Install the opener as the default
urllib.request.install_opener(opener)

# Now, you can make requests using urllib.request and the certificate will be validated
response = urllib.request.urlopen('https://example.com')

# Check the validation result
if response.status == 200:
    print("Certificate is valid.")
else:
    print("Certificate is not valid.")
